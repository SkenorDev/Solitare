Patterns: I used flyweight pattern for the cards by having a template card and simply changing the data within, overall though I really didnt apply many patterns on purpose and its pure coincidence if their there

reflection: this code is a mess as theres simply way too much code in main with little to no helper functions. When I redo the code I will make a helper function and a meta table for containing the solitare data which will substatinally lower the amount of lines in main. I need to add a lot more comments forsure and I wrote it and Im forgetting how my own logic works.
