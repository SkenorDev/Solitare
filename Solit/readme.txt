1. For my code almost all my work is in the main file. This is suboptimal and a nightmare for others to work on however 
this is the only way I can personally get this done in the alloted time as I really struggle with making files work together

2. A lot of the work is in properly named functions but it can be improved

3. I dont need an outside opinion to get a most likely no

4. compartamentalize work to seperate files for future projects

5. Using flyweight to establish the variables of cards, could also use to make assets however I think the premade are a lot prettier
